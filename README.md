# Icelake: A native Rust interface to [Apache Iceberg](https://iceberg.apache.org/).

This library aims to provide full access and management capabilities to Iceberg tables
in Rust, so that it can be used with Rust data processing frameworks like 
[datafusion](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion),
[ballista](https://github.com/apache/arrow-ballista) and
[polars](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars).
